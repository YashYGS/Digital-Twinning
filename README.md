National Science Foundation (NSF - REU) - Software Engineering Intern (Digital Twinning)                                      
- This project is part of my work as a programmer on Digital Twinning at the Digital Twin Labs with Professor Jiansong Zhang at Purdue. 
- Utilized Webots to model and program the functionalities of a Patented Robot with a custom End Effector that uses Vacuum suction mechanism to move panels to perform construction with C Programming. (This simulation was converted into an actual 
robot at the construction engineering labs at Purdue) 
- Modeled and Programmed digital replicas to replicate Automated Driving Algorithms and Systems with Research experience.
- The progarmming files in this repository contain parts of my code that include fucntions to simulate the actions of the robot, such as its movements on various planes, with various environments, differnt uses of its arms etc.
